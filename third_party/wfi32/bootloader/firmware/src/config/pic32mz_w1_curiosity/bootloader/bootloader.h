/* Function:
    bool bootloader_Trigger( void );

Summary:
    Checks if Bootloader has to be executed at startup.

Description:
    This function can be used to check for a External HW trigger or Internal firmware
    trigger to execute bootloader at startup.

    This check should happen before any system resources are initialized apart for PORT
    as the same system resource can be Re-initialized by the application if bootloader jumps
    to it and may cause issues.

    - <b>External Trigger: </b>
        Is achieved by triggering the selected GPIO_PIN in bootloader configuration
        in MHC.
    - <b>Firmware Trigger: </b>
        Application firmware which wants to execute bootloader at startup needs to
        fill first 16 bytes of ram location with bootloader request pattern.

        <code>
            uint32_t *sram = (uint32_t *)RAM_START_ADDRESS;

            sram[0] = 0x5048434D;
            sram[1] = 0x5048434D;
            sram[2] = 0x5048434D;
            sram[3] = 0x5048434D;
        </code>

Precondition:
    PORT/PIO Initialize must have been called.

Parameters:
    None.

Returns:
    - True  : If any of trigger is detected.
    - False : If no trigger is detected..

Example:
    <code>

        NVMCTRL_Initialize();

        PORT_Initialize();

        if (bootloader_Trigger() == false)
        {
            run_Application();
        }

        CLOCK_Initialize();

    </code>

bool bootloader_Trigger( void );

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    void run_Application( void );

Summary:
    Runs the programmed application at startup.

Description:
    This function can be used to run programmed application though bootloader at startup.

    If the first 4Bytes of Application Memory is not 0xFFFFFFFF then it jumps to
    the application start address to run the application programmed through bootloader and
    never returns.

    If the first 4Bytes of Application Memory is 0xFFFFFFFF then it returns from function
    and executes bootloader for accepting a new application firmware.

Precondition:
    bootloader_Trigger() must be called to check for bootloader triggers at startup.

Parameters:
    None.

Returns:
    None

Example:
    <code>

        NVMCTRL_Initialize();

        PORT_Initialize();

        if (bootloader_Trigger() == false)
        {
            run_Application();
        }

        CLOCK_Initialize();

    </code>

void run_Application( void );

// *****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    void bootloader_Tasks( void );

 Summary:
    Starts bootloader execution.

 Description:
    This function can be used to start bootloader execution.

    The function continuously waits for application firmware from the HOST via
    selected communication protocol to program into internal flash memory.

    Once the complete application is received, programmed and verified successfully,
    It resets the device to jump into programmed application.

    Note:
    For Optimized Bootloaders:
        - This function never returns.
        - This function will be directly called from main function

    For Unified and File System based Bootloaders:
        - This function returns once the state machine execution is completed
        - This function will be called from SYS_Tasks() routine from the super loop

 Precondition:
    bootloader_Trigger() must be called to check for bootloader triggers at startup.

 Parameters:
    None.

 Returns:
    None

 Example:
    <code>

        bootloader_Tasks();

    </code>
